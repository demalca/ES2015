// Quiz

// What is the difference between var and let?

// For var, it can be re-declared and reassigned, and also hoisting applies. Let can only be reassigned, doesn’t hoist and creates a block scoped variable.

// What is the difference between var and const?

// Const creates a block scoped variable, can’t be re-declared nor reassigned and will not hoist.

// What is the difference between let and const?

// Let can be reassigned, const can’t be.

// What is hoisting?

// If var is used, it is declared at top of script. This doesn’t happen for let and const.
